# Power-BI-SQL-Weather-Poland
This project was developed as part of postgraduate studies in Data Science. It includes collecting, processing, and visualizing meteorological data (temperature and precipitation) from 1966 to 2022. Tools such as Excel, Power BI, and SQL were used to analyze long-term climate trends and create an interactive dashboard.

Overview

This project explores long-term climate trends in Poland using historical meteorological data from IMGW (Polish Institute of Meteorology and Water Management). It focuses on changes in temperature and precipitation patterns over the period 1966â€“2022.

The project was created as part of a postgraduate program in Data Science and Data Analytics and showcases a complete data analysis pipeline â€“ from data acquisition to an interactive Power BI dashboard.

ðŸ“‚ Data Sources
CSV files with historical monthly averages (temperature, rainfall, snow cover) for multiple weather stations in Poland
file with geolocation and metadata for each station
Data obtained from IMGW

ðŸ”§ Tools and Technologies
Excel â€“ initial data cleaning and transformation
SQL â€“ preprocessing and exploratory queries
Power Query (Power BI) â€“ further data wrangling and merging
Power BI â€“ data modeling and interactive visualizations

ðŸ“ˆ Dashboard Highlights
The final Power BI dashboard includes:
Temperature and precipitation trends over time
Seasonal and regional comparisons
Snow cover visualizations
Interactive map of telemetry stations with drill-through analysis
Parameter switching between variables (e.g., snow vs. rain)

ðŸŽ¯ Goals
Understand how climate has changed across different regions of Poland
Present findings in an accessible, interactive format
Practice working with real-world public data in a complete data pipeline
